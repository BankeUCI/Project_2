### Loading Transformed CSV Files

1. Create Database in PostgreSQL
2. Create tables with columns required
3. Read transformed files from Output folder
4. Connect to the database
5. Load tables in sequence
     - load events table
     - load discipline table
     - load medals table
     - load teams table
     - load coaches table

### Challenge faced
